# Robot-Character-Identification


I wrote a program in ROS to guide a robot to navigate a small randomly oriented set of rooms to find the room marked by a green circle.   

It would then analyse and identify the correct Cluedo character and save a picture and text file identifying the character  

I also made a video that showed how the robot worked, and wrote a report explaining the code and methodology. All code was written by me, although unfortunately our gitlab repository was lost when my university email was shut down. However, the repor does contain large portions of the Python code.
